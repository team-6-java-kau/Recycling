our project is about recyling factory java simulation we want to make a finacial study with two phases one with employees and one with sensors there will be a main path that the material go through and the employee seperate it depending on its material type plastic, glass, paper, metal and it will be random values each time we run the simulation for the order of the materials and the same order will go to the next phase with sensors doing the job and we comapre the time and the objects done and errors by the employee and other metrics



We have a project in java that should use all oop ideas and it should be a simulation with two phasesPhase one will be the problem simulation and second phase is the solution the idea is that there is a resycling factory it work on employee judgment on the what the material is they take more time that will cost the factory the solution is an automated factory that have sensors to sort the materials automatically the simulation should be the user inputs the amount on tons of materials entering the factory then we will generate a random list of objects that will go through the employees factory in 9 hours with breaks and then the same list goes to the autumated factory it will work for 9 hours theb we will compare the metrics we got to show how good the solution is the simulation will show the items moving in a line then it will stop in the sorting place till the employee identifies it and sort it also for the automatic factory the gui in java fx please help me what should i do
